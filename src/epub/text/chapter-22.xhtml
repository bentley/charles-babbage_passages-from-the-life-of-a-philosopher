<p><i>Lord George.</i> (<i>Mumbling</i>). The reform Member for Puddledock,
isn’t he?—the author of a book on Pinmaking, and
things of that kind. An ironmonger in Newgate-street!</p>
<p><i>Trim.</i> No, no! Member for Shoreditch;—with Smooth,
the Colonial Secretary!</p>
<p><i>Lord Charles.</i> (<i>Taking the cigar from his mouth.</i>) I think
I’ve heard something of him at Cambridge: he was Newtonian
Professor of Chemistry when I was at College.</p>
<p><i>Trim.</i> Can’t we talk him over?</p>
<p><i>Lord Charles.</i> No, no! he is too sharp for that.</p>
<p><i>Trim.</i> Will anybody speak to him?—and if he won’t vote
with us, keep him out of the way.</p>
<p><i>Marquis.</i> Perhaps a hint at an <span class="nowrap">appointment!—</span></p>

spirit; and devilish proud. <span class="xxpn" id="p278">{278}</span></p>

employ himself?—who are his friends?</p>
<p><i>Trim.</i> Why he’s—a sort of a—phi­los­o­pher,—that wants to
be a man of the world!</p>
<p><i>Lord Flumm.</i> Oh!—now I begin to recollect;—I must
have seen him at Sir Phillip’s. Leave him to me;—I think
Lady Flumm and my daughter can manage to keep him
quiet on Thursday night.</p>
<p><i>Trim.</i> But for Tuesday,—my Lord?</p>

<p><i>Turnstile.</i> This will never do! They make use of
me, and laugh at me in their sleeves;—push me round and go by. That
break down <i>was</i> a devil of a business! They didn’t laugh out to be
sure; but they coughed and looked unutterably!! And where is this to
end? What shall I have to show for it? Confounded loss of time;—to hear
those fellows prosing, instead of seeing the oc­cul­ta­tion last night.
And that book of Ls.’; so much that <i>I</i> had begun upon,—and might have
finished! It never will do! (<i>Rousing himself after a pause.</i>) But
knowledge, after all, <i>is</i> power! That at least is certain,—power—to do
what? to refuse Lord Doodle’s invitation; and to ask Lord Humbug for a
favour, which it is ten to one he will refuse! But the Royal Society
is defunct! That I <i>have</i> accomplished. Gilbert, and the Duke! and the
Secretaries! I have driven them all before me!—and, now, though <i>I</i>
must not be a knight of the Guelphic order, (yet a riband is a pretty
looking thing! and <span class="xxpn" id="p279">{279}</span> a star
too!—) I will show that I can teach <i>them</i> how to make knights; and
describe the decorations that other men are to wear. But here comes
Lord Flumm, and I am saved the bore of calling upon him.</p>

<p><i>Lord Flumm.</i> Mr. Turnstile, if I do not mistake! My
dear Turnstile: how glad I am to see you again! it <i>was</i> kind of Sir
Phillip to introduce me. You know that you are near our house; and Lady
Flumm will be so <span class="nowrap">happy——</span></p></div>
<p><i>Turnstile.</i> In truth, my Lord, I was about to call upon you.
After what you were so good as to say last night, I took the
first opportunity.</p>
<p><i>Lord Flumm.</i> Well, that <i>is</i> kind. But you did not speak
last night. How came that? I don’t find you in the paper,
yet the subject was quite your own. Tallow and bar-iron,
raw materials and machinery. Ah, my dear sir! when
science condescends to come among us mortals, the effects to
be expected <i>are</i> wonderful indeed!</p>
<p><i>Turnstile.</i> My Lord, you flatter. But we have reached
your door. (<i>Aside.</i>) [Confound him!—But I am glad he was
not in the house. It’s clear he hasn’t heard of the break
down.]</p>
<p><i>Lord Flumm.</i> While I have you to myself, Turnstile,
remember that you dine with me on Tuesday. I am to have
two friends, Lord <span class="nowrap">S——</span> and Sir George
<span class="nowrap">Y——,</span> who wish
very much to be acquainted with you. Half-past seven.</p>
<p><i>Turnstile.</i> You are very good, my lord. I dare not refuse
so kind an invitation.

you have so long wished to know. Mr. Turnstile,—Lady
Flumm.</p></div>
<p><i>Lady Flumm.</i> <i>The</i> Mr. Turnstile. My dear sir, I am too
happy to see you. We had just been speaking of your
delightful book. Selina! (<i>Calling.</i>) [<i>Enter</i>
<span class="smcap">L<b>ADY</b></span>
<span class="smcap">S<b>ELINA</b>.</span>]
This is Mr. Turnstile.</p>
<p><i>Lady Selina.</i> Indeed!</p>
<p><i>Lady Flumm.</i> Yes, indeed! You see he is a mortal man
after all. Bring me, my love, the book you will find open
on the table in the boudoir. I wish to show Mr. Turnstile
the passages I have marked this morning.</p>
<p><i>Lady Selina.</i> (<i>Re­turn­ing with the book, and run­ning over
the leaves.</i>) “Lace made by ca­ter­pil­lars.”—“Steam-engines
with fairy fingers.”—“Robe of na­ture.”—“Sun of science.”—“Fal­ter­ing
wor­ship­per.”—“Al­tar of truth.” It <i>is, in­deed</i>,
de­light­ful! The taste, the poet­i­cal imag­i­na­tion, are sur­pris­ing.
I hope, Mr. Turn­stile,—in­deed I am sure, that you
love music?</p>
<p><i>Turnstile.</i> Not <i>very</i> par­tic­u­lar­ly, I must ac­knowl­edge
(<i>smiling</i>); a bar­rel-organ is the in­stru­ment most in my way.</p>
<p><i>Lady Flumm.</i> (<i>Smiling.</i>) Music and machinery, Mr. Turnstile.
Polite literature and mathematics. You <i>do</i> know how
to combine. Others must judge of the pro­founder parts of
your works; but the style, and the fancy, are what I should
most admire.—You dine with Lord Flumm, he tells me, on
Tuesday. Now you <i>must</i> come to <i>me</i> on Thursday night.</p>
<p><i>Turnstile.</i> I am sorry to say, that, on recollection,
I <i>ought</i> to <span class="xxpn" id="p281">{281}</span>
have apologized to Lord Flumm. The Pottery Question
stands for Tuesday; and I should be there, as one of the
Committee; and Thursday, your Ladyship knows, is the
second reading of the Place and Pension Bill.</p>
<p><i>Lady Flumm.</i> Oh, we are Staffordshire people! <i>that</i> will
excuse you to the pottery folks; and, for Thursday, I <i>will</i>
absolutely take no excuse. We have Pasta and Donzelli!
perhaps a quadrille afterwards—(you dance, Mr. Turnstile?)—and
Lady Sophia <span class="nowrap">C——</span> and her cousin, Lord
<span class="nowrap">F——,</span> have
said <i>so much</i> about those beautiful passages at the end of your
book, that they will be quite disappointed if I do not keep
my promise to introduce them. (<i>Touching his arm with her
finger.</i>)</p>
<p><i>Turnstile.</i> Your Ladyship knows how to conquer: I feel
that I <i>cannot</i> refuse.

<div><i>Enter</i>
<span class="smcap">G<b>RISKIN</b>,</span> <i>hastily, heated; his hat in his left hand; a

<p><i>Griskin.</i> Mr. Turnstile, I’m glad to find you; just called
on you, as I came to this quarter to look after a customer—long
way from the City—sorry not to hear from you.</p>
<p><i>Turnstile.</i> Why, really, Mr. Griskin, I am very sorry;
but I am not acquainted with the Commander-in-chief. And
I must say that I should not know how to
press for the <span class="xxpn" id="p282">{282}</span>
contract, knowing that your nephew’s prices are thirty per cent.,
at least, above the market.</p>
<p><i>Griskin.</i> That’s being rather nice, I should say, Mr. Turnstile.
My nephew is as good a lad as ever stood in shoe-leather;
and has six good wotes in Shoreditch,—and, as to
myself, Mr. Turnstile, I must say that, after all I did at
your election—and in such wery hot weather—I did not
expect you’d be so wery particular about a small matter.—Sir,
I wish you a good morning.</p>
<p><i>Turnstile.</i> (<i>Bowing and looking after him.</i>) So this fellow,
like the rest of them, thinks that I am to do his jobs, and to
neglect my own. And this is your <i>reformed</i> Parliament.</p>

none the worse for it?</p></div>
<p><i>Tripes.</i> Oh dear sir, no! Mrs. Tripes and my daughters

<p><i>Smooth.</i> And your boys, how are they?—fine, promising,
active fellows.—You’ve heard from MacLeech?</p>
<p><i>Tripes.</i> Just received the note as I left home.</p>
<p><i>Smooth.</i> All is quite right, you see, your cousin has the
appointment at the Cape. I knew MacLeech was just the
man for the details. A ship, I find, is to sail in about three
weeks; and (<i>significantly</i>) I don’t think your cousin need be
<i>very</i> scrupulous about freight and passage.</p>
<p><i>Tripes.</i> You are too good, Mr. Smooth. I’m sure if anything
that I can do,—my sense of
all your <span class="nowrap">kindness——</span>

<span class="smcap">T<b>RIPES</b>.</span></div>
<p>Well Mr. Tripes, I’m glad to see you. Pray take a chair.</p>
<p><i>Tripes.</i> We hoped to have seen you at the meeting yesterday,
sir. Capital speech from Mr. Smooth. You know, of
course, that Mr. Highway is a candidate; and Mr. MacLeech
is talked of;—very sorry, indeed, you weren’t there.</p>
<p><i>Turnstile.</i> A transit of Venus, Mr. Tripes, is a thing that
does not happen every day. Besides,
my friend, Stellini <span class="xxpn" id="p284">{284}</span>
from Palermo, is here; and I had promised to go with him to
Greenwich.</p>
<p><i>Tripes.</i> Almost a pity, sir, to call off your attention from
such objects. But in the City we are men of business, you
know,—plain, every-day people.</p>
<p><i>Turnstile.</i> It was unlucky; but I could not help it. The
committee, I hope, is by this time at work?</p>
<p><i>Tripes.</i> It was just that, I called about. I wished to tell
you myself how very sorry I am that I cannot be your chairman.
But—my large family—press of business,—in short,—you
must excuse me;—and, if I should be upon Mr.
Smooth’s committee, I don’t well see how I can attend to
both.</p>
<p><i>Turnstile.</i> Smooth!—but he and I go together, you know,—at
least, I understood it so.</p>
<p><i>Tripes.</i> I’m glad to hear it; I feared there might be some
mistake. And, if Mr. MacLeech comes forward,—being a
fellow-townsman of Mr. Smooth, and a good deal in the
Glasgow interest;—a commercial man too, Mr. Turnstile;—a
<i>practical</i> man—Mr. Turnstile;—I am not quite sure that you
can count upon Mr. Smooth’s assistance;—and Government,
you know, is strong.</p>
<p><i>Turnstile.</i> Assistance, Mr. Tripes,—from Smooth!—why
I came in on my own ground;—on the <i>Independent</i>
interest.—Assistance from Smooth!—Besides,—Smooth knows very
well that <i>our</i> second votes secured him.</p>
<p><i>Tripes.</i> Very true, sir; but these Independent people are
hard to deal with; and Mr. Highway, I assure you, hit very
hard in his speech at the meeting yesterday. He talked of
amateur politicians,—attention to the business of the
people,—dinners with the opposite party. In short, I fear, they
will say,—like the others,—that what they
want is something <span class="xxpn" id="p285">{285}</span>
of “a <i>practical man</i>” Mr. Turnstile.—I’m sorry that I must
be going.—Sir, your servant.</p>

<p><i>Lord A.</i> That point being settled, gentlemen, the sooner
you are at your posts the better. The King comes down to
dissolve on Friday.<a class="afnanc" href="#fn40" id="fnanc40">40</a>
But, before we part,
we had better <span class="xxpn" id="p286">{286}</span>
decide about this Presidency of the Board of Man­u­fac­tures.
The appointment requires an able man; of <i>rather</i> peculiar
attainments. Mr. Turnstile has been mentioned to me; and
his claims I am told, are strong:—long devotion to science,—great
expense and loss of time for public objects,—high reputation,
and weight of opinion, as a man of science.</p>
<div class="dftnt">
<p class="pfirst"><a class="afnlabel" href="#fnanc40" id="fn40">40</a>
Parliament is ordinarily dissolved by Proclamation, after
having been previously prorogued. However, there is at least one
modern instance to justify the historical consistency of the text,
namely, that which occurred on the 10th June, 1818, when the Prince
Regent, afterwards George IV., dissolved the Parliament in person. The
Dramatist cannot therefore be properly accused of drawing heedlessly
upon his imagination, though even had he thus far transgressed the
boundaries of historical truth, Horace’s maxim might have been pleaded
in <span class="nowrap">excuse:—</span></p>
<div class="dpoemctr"><div class="dstanzactr">

</div>
<p><i>Smooth.</i> I believe that he has left <i>science</i>; at least, he
wishes it to be so considered. He is my colleague at Shoreditch;
and, of course, I wish to support him;—but,—when
business is to be done;—and men,—and things, to be brought
together,—I own,—I <i>doubt</i>—whether a more practical man,—might
<span class="nowrap">not——</span></p>
<p><i>Shift.</i> And <i>that</i> poor Turnstile certainly is not. He must
always have <i>a reason</i>;—nothing but the <i>quod erat demonstrandum</i>;
a romancer; if you have anything to do, his first object
is <i>to do it well</i>. I am quite sure he will not answer our purpose.</p>
<p><i>Closewind.</i> He talks too much about consistency; and on
party questions, you are never sure of him: last week he did
not divide with us, on either night.</p>
<p><i>Lord A.</i> Well; <i>I</i> am quite indifferent. I did hear of his
being at Lord Flumm’s; and after what had just passed in
the Lords, a personal friend of mine would, perhaps, have

<p><i>Shift.</i> (<i>Laughing.</i>) Pooh! Pooh! Poor Gilbert! No,
that will never do.</p>
<p><i>Smooth.</i> Or—Warburton?</p>
<p><i>Shift.</i> (<i>Sneering.</i>) Worse and worse!—if <i>ever</i> there was
an <span class="nowrap">impracticable——</span></p>
<p><i>Closewind.</i> But we don’t know that Turnstile is sure of his
seat. Smooth, hasn’t MacLeech been talked
of for Shoreditch? <span class="xxpn" id="p287">{287}</span></p>
<p><i>Smooth.</i> He’s <i>certain</i> of succeeding! The independent
gentlemen don’t quite like Turnstile—they wish for Highway—and
the split will foil them both. MacLeech—now that
he has been mentioned—I must acknowledge, does seem to
me to be the <i>very</i> man for the man­u­fac­tures,—a practical,
persevering man of business,—never absent from the House,—excellent
Scotch connections,—a cousin of the Duke of
<span class="nowrap">Y.’s——.</span></p>
<p><i>Lord A.</i> That is a good point, certainly. An appointment
given there would be candid and liberal;—it might
<span class="nowrap">conciliate——</span></p>
<p><i>Closewind.</i> A very civil, excellent fellow, too. MacLeech,
<i>I</i> should say, is the man.</p>
<p><i>Shift.</i> I quite agree with you.</p>
<p><i>Smooth.</i> I confess, I think he will fill the office well. And
if it is thought quite necessary that Hume’s motion to reduce
the salary,—though it is not <span class="nowrap">large——</span></p>
<p><i>Closewind.</i> Oh, no! The salary had better remain;—2000 <i>l.</i>
is not too much. Besides, the <i>principle</i> of giving way
is bad.</p>
<p><i>Lord A.</i> Well, gentlemen, let it be so. Smooth, you
will let MacLeech know that he has the office.</p>
<p><i>Smooth.</i> And at the present salary?</p>
<p><i>Lord A.</i> Agreed.

<p><i>Atall.</i> (<i>Decliningly.</i>) These things, you know, are always
supposed to be anonymous. But I am not sorry that you
liked the paper. Did his lordship
speak of it? <span class="xxpn" id="p288">{288}</span></p>
<p><i>Smooth.</i> The book was open at the article upon the table.
It does you honour. Hits <i>just</i> the happy point,—hints probable
<i>intentions</i>, without giving any pledge,—enough to please
the Liberals,—and full room for <i>explanation</i>, if any change
becomes expedient. The true plan, believe me, for a ministry,
in times like these, is to proceed <i>en tâtonnant</i>.—Pray, Mr.
Dean, how is the Bishop of Hereford?</p>
<p><i>Atall.</i> I didn’t know that he was par­tic­u­lar­ly ill. He has
long been feeble.</p>
<p><i>Smooth.</i> These complainers do sometimes hold out. But
they cannot last for ever.—We meet I hope to-morrow at the
levee. You <i>ought</i> to be there.</p>
<p><i>Atall.</i> I have come to town for the purpose; having
secured, I think, Closewind’s election at Cambridge.</p>
<p><i>Smooth.</i> Well done, my very good friend! Men of talent
should always pull together. Sorry that I must go; but we
meet to-morrow. (<i>Shaking hands very cordially.</i>)

<p><i>Turnstile.</i> My dear Byeways; I want your assistance.
Deserted by those shabby dogs the Radicals, and tricked, I
fear, by the Whigs, I find I have no chance of a decent show
of numbers at the next election, if my scientific friends do
not support me with spirit. Even so, it <i>can</i> be only an
honourable retreat. I count upon <i>you</i>,—you understand the
world;—and as soon as we can muster a committee, you
must be my chairman.</p></div>
<p><i>Byeways.</i> My good friend, don’t be in a hurry; sit down
and tell me all about it. I know you don’t care much about
your seat,—and after all,—it is,—to you,
a waste of <span class="xxpn" id="p289">{289}</span>
time;—but, with the Independents at your back, you are secure. As
to me, my dear fellow, you know that I <span class="nowrap">am——</span></p>
<p><i>Turnstile.</i> But man! the Independents, as you call them,
have taken up Highway; he blusters, and goes any length.</p>
<p><i>Byeways.</i> But Smooth, you know, is strong in Shoreditch,—Government
interest,—you brought him in last time; and
you and he, <span class="nowrap">together——</span></p>
<p><i>Turnstile.</i> I know it; but he says he is not <i>strong enough</i>
to run any risk. If you will be my chairman, with a good
committee, we may at least die game.</p>
<p><i>Byeways.</i> My dear Turnstile, you know how glad I always
am to serve you—and you know what <i>I think</i>;—but in my
situation, my dear fellow, it is quite impossible that I can
<i>oppose</i> the ministers. MacLeech too, they say, is a candidate;
and his brother-in-law’s uncle was very civil, last year, in
Scotland, to my wife’s cousin.—But I <i>have</i> a plan for you.
There is Atall, just come to town; make <i>him</i> your chief, and
bring the Cambridge men together. The clergy were always
strong in Shoreditch. Atall can speak to them.—I am
obliged to go to the War Office.—And you had better lose no
time in seeing Atall. Sorry to bid you good-bye.

<p><i>Lord Flumm.</i> There, Lady Selina, so much for your
philosophic friend. Poor Turnstile! What a business he
<i>has</i> made of it. Here is the “Times,” with the report of the
Shoreditch election meeting. Turnstile has no chance. The
Scotchmen coalesce; Highway none of us can think of; and
Smooth and MacLeech walk over the ground in triumph;
and then, the Presidency of Man­u­fac­tures, the <i>very</i> appointment
for which poor Turnstile was fitted (and, to do the
poor devil justice, he could have filled it well), is given to
MacLeech, a Scotch hanger on, or distant cousin of Smooth’s,
and with the old salary, in spite of all that Hume could say
against it.—Bravo! Reform, and the Whigs for ever!—We
Tories could not have done the business in a better style.</p>
<div><i>Enter a Footman.</i></div>
<p><i>Footman.</i> Mr. Turnstile, my Lady, sends up his card.</p>
<p><i>Lady Flumm.</i> Oh, not at home! And Sleek, put a memorandum
in the visiting-book, that we are “out of town,”
whenever Mr. Turnstile calls.</p>

<p><i>Turnstile.</i> Then all is up. What a fool have I been to embark
upon this sea of trouble! Two years of trifling and lost time; while
others have been making discoveries and adding to their reputation.
Those <i>rascal</i> Whigs, my blood boils to think of them. I can forgive

Smooth; the sleek, sly, steering of that knave MacLeech;
and yet they <i>must</i> succeed. There’s no help for it. I <i>am</i>
fairly beaten—thrown overboard, with not a leg to stand
upon; and all I have to do is to go to bed now, to sleep off

be myself once more.</p>
